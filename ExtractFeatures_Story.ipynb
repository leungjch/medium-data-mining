       "      <td>[To build a website in 2018 is an easy but time consuming task â if youâre not already a web developer. All you need to do is:Know HTML and CSSLearn about responsive design and developmentPurchase a domain name &amp; hosting plan from someone like BluehostThatâs pretty much it. It getâs more complex for more advanced websites with custom software and features, but thatâs what you hire a web developer for! Nowadays, the average person is using a website building platform to easily get their website up and running. These sites are a bit limiting and you canât do everything you want to do, but itâs quick and easy!There are dozens of website builder platforms out there but here are the most popular.As you can see, the most popular website builders a.k.a âContent Management Systemsâ are:WordPress (FREE) â 51%Wix (paid) â 7%Joomla (paid) â 4%Squarespace (paid) â 4%Weebly (paid) â 4%Why do people prefer WordPress?WordPress is amazing. Well, for starters, iâm a wordpress developer! I build customWordpress themes and manage WordPress websites everyday. 70% of my web design business comes from WordPress! People mainly use it because itâs free and open-source, which means itâs always being updated and improved by developers around the world.WordPress as a Content Management System (CMS) is extremely flexible and used by huge companies. You can create massive online stores, small portfolio websites and much more!But more importantly:Learning to code a website from scratch can take 6+ months, let alone CSS and PHP. Having a basic knowledge of HTML can help you gauge things more quickly, but if you want to create a website within a day or two, learning HTML isnât a viable option.General website builders like Wix are expensive and often very limited. They are good for one-page websites, but not more.How to build a website with wordpressFirst, you need to purchase a hosting plan and a domain name from a web hosting company. The customer service rep can get you all set up and walk you through their interface. They will even install WordPress for you! Most of these hosting companies do this for free.Once installed, you can access theWordpress admin by typing in www.yourdomain.com/wp-admin. You will obviously need to replace âyourdomain.comâ with your actual domain. Once logged in, you should see aWordpress Dashboard, similar to below:Everyones WordPress Dashboard will look slightly different, but each WordPress Website has a:Posts SectionPages SectionMedia SectionPlugin SectionWordPress PostA WordPress âpostâ is, well, what youâre currently reading. Itâs essentially a blog post. Itâs a piece of content you add to your website, an article, a tutorial, etc.WordPress PageA WordPress Page is a newly created page in your website. Itâs an easy way for you to continue to add pages to your website without having to call a web developer for your every need.WordPress Media SectionThis is where you add all of your images and videos that you want to use in your posts and pages, as mentioned above. Once you place images and videos in the media panel, you may use them anywhere you like in your wordpress website!WordPress PluginsWordPress Plugins are really the powerhouse behind this CMS. They allow you to extend and add functionality to your current wordpress theme that wasnât built into it by default. Think of them as âappsâ for your website. They add functionality! Similar to the iOS app store, there are millions of wordpress plugins available for download.WordPress ThemesJust like apps and plugins, there are millions of WordPress themes you can choose from. Some are free and others are not. WordPress themes can cost from $20 â $60 dollars. You can also hire a web developer, like me :), to build you a Custom WordPress Theme for you or your business. Wordpres themes are very easy to install. Simply go navigate to your WordPress Dashboard -&gt; Appearance -&gt; Themes. Here you can upload a .zip file of a theme and wordpress takes care of the rest!Overall a CMS is going to be the fastest way for you to get a website up and running quickly and cheaply. If you have any questions or need any help, please feel free to contact me anytime and iâd love to learn about your project and see if I can provide some free help!Originally published at ryanthedeveloper.com on December 26, 2018.]</td>\n",

       "      <td>[17 Dec 2018 in English on Programming, PythonIn this article, we will implement a lazy list that will be much like Data.List in Haskellâ actually itâll share most of the API with the Haskell list. Donât you worry about it. Weâre using Python here, and youâre not expected to have any experience with Haskell. Itâs recommended that you have some experience with functional programming.The complete code for the project can be find here on Github.What is a lazy list? Before we enter the main topic here, Iâll first clear it up for some of you, so you will at least have some clues to what weâre going to do. (safely skip to the next topic if you already know what a lazy list is)First, Iâll explain what is laziness. Imagine we have the following code:def f(a): b = list(g(x) for x in a) return b def main(): a = [1, 3, 5, 8] b = f(a) c = f(b) print(b[2])wherea is a list, and g(x) is some arbitrary function that does whatever it wants to an element in a and returns a value. Presented with this piece of code, a programmer equipped with sharp eyes will observe the following:We never used c in the code, but still we computed it for every element in b.We only make use of b[2] even though weâve computed g(x) for every element in a. If g(x) is expensive, the overhead here is unacceptable.The presented code can be easily optimized by removing the unnecessary computations, even smart compilers might be able to do the optimization for you. But in reality things can grow trickier: Sometimes we will want to access multiple elements in b, sometimes we will want elements in c or more complex structures, and we donât know which element we want until runtimeâ¦ Of course, thereâs always the option of optimizing them by hand, but can they somehow be magically resolved so we programmers donât have to worry anymore? The answer is yes: with the introduction of laziness.Laziness is a description of the programâs behavior: we donât evaluate the value of a statement until it is actually needed. For example, the execution of the above code will be like the following:a is defined.b is defined, OK. Iâll compute it if it is needed afterwards.c is defined, OK. Iâll compute it if it is needed afterwards.Oops, you are requesting the value of b[2]. Let me see.. according to the previous instructions it should be the value of g(a[2])â¦Yes, Iâve got g(x) and a[2]â¦.OK, it is here. Just print it.Iâve somehow over-humanized the process, but this is how it is like. The program doesnât do what it is told to do immediately â it only does so when the value is actually needed. And then, with a lazy list, we would be able to do all sorts of thingsâ¦ Iâll show them to you in the end.A First StepFirst letâs review what a lazy list is like: rather than just store computed results, it only compute needed elements lazily. In order to achieve that, it should be able to keep the information how each element of its should be like, and evaluate them when needed. To implement one, the key problem would be to determine how we keep the information of how the elements should be computed.What we desire here is a way to get the value of an element given its index i. Naturally this leads us to functions: a function with an argument i and returns the value at that index. We will also need a way to cache the result of this function since we donât want to evaluate the value every time. Here we just use a dict for that purpose. Finally our draft version of LazyList would be like this:class LazyList(object): def __init__(self, func): self.func = func self.cache = dict() def __getitem__(self, key): if key in self.cache: return self.cache[key] self._evaluate(key) return self.cache[key] def _evaluate(self, i): self.cache[i] = self.func(i)where func is the function that can get the value elements for us, and cache is a dictionary that keeps the computed values so we wonât need to compute them again if we need the same value in the future.Now with LazyList defined, we can already define a few handful lists and functions:# list of natural numbers naturals = LazyList(lambda i: i) # list of zeros zeros = LazyList(lambda _: 0) # list of ones ones = LazyList(lambda _: 1) def make_lazy_list(iterable): \"\"\"returns a LazyList made from iterable\"\"\" copy = list(iterable) return LazyList(lambda i: copy[i]) def repeat(item): \"\"\"returns an infinite list whose elements all equal to item\"\"\" return LazyList(lambda _: item)Note that naturals, zeros and ones are all lists with infinite elements! Now we already have something that ordinary Python list doesnât support. However, these functions and lists alone arenât really of any use. The true power of LazyList will reveal itself only with the presence of a bunch of higher-order functions.A Glimpse of FunctionYouâve probably already noticed the use of lambdas in the code above. Theyâre just shortcuts for defining anonymous functions. Fortunate for us, functions are first-class citizens in Python, which means that we can pass them around like any other object. This brings a lot of flexibility to us.First letâs implement the probably most used function â map. Yes, this map is almost the same as Pythonâs built-in map, except that it returns a new LazyList rather than modifying the called LazyList. Our LazyList is immutable viewed from the outer world. Actually, a list which is both lazy and mutable makes no sense. Iâll leave that for you to think about.class LazyList(object): ... def map(self, f): return LazyList(lambda i: f(self[i])) def __add__(self, other): \"\"\"Returns list with the provided list concatenated to the end of `self`.\"\"\" def getitem(_, i): try: return self[i] except IndexError: return other[i - len(self)] return LazyList(getitem)The implementation is very straightforward and doesnât really require any thought at all. With map at hand, we can do various things. Our code at the start of this post can be changed to this:def main(): a = make_lazy_list([1, 3, 5, 8]) b = a.map(g) c = b.map(g) print(b[2])Now the list is lazy and we donât have to worry about doing more-than-necessary computations! g(x) will only be called once on a[2] and itâs done automatically. Great!We can also implement take, drop in this way, but thatâs about where it ends. To implement functions like filter, append, concat or tails, our naive implementation here is just not enough. We will need to keep track of size information and treat infinite lists as a special case. Iâve met and solved a few interesting problems during the way, but the core concept is the same: we save the function that gets the value, and evaluate only when needed. For more reference, you could go inspect the source code.For now, letâs pretend that weâve solve all of the implementation details and have a working lazy list, what next?A Taste of FruitFirst, Iâm going to show you the famous Haskell 4-line quicksort:quicksort [] = [] quicksort (p:xs) = (quicksort lesser) ++ [p] ++ (quicksort greater) where lesser = filter (&lt; p) xs greater = filter (&gt;= p) xsBefore we show you the magical code, one thing that might need explanation is call function. It takes a function and applies the function to itself lazily. The code would probably help:def call(self, f): \"\"\"Returns list which is the result of applying `f` to `self`.\"\"\" result = None def getitem(_, i): nonlocal result if result: return result[i] result = f(self) return result[i] return LazyList(getitem)call is needed because Python itself doesnât provide lazy evaluation. If we want to make quicksort lazy, we have to make it part of our implementation.Anyway, here is our code:def quicksort(a): if len(a) &lt;= 1: return a p, xs = a[0], a[1:] lesser, greater = xs.partition(lambda x: x &lt; p) return lesser.call(quicksort) + make_lazylist([p]) + greater.call(quicksort)The code is incredibly short! Also, in a similar fashion, we can translate the Haskell one-liner that computes all the primes. Here are the original and our Python version:let pgen (p:xs) = p : pgen [x|x &lt;- xs, x `mod` p &gt; 0]pgen contains all the prime numbers! You might have doubt upon this: it canât contain all the prime numbers. But this is the fact: Although there are infinite as many prime numbers, we also have an equally infinite list here.def prims(l): p, xs = l[0], l[1:] return make_lazylist([p]) + xs.filter(lambda x: x % p != 0).call(prims) pgen = prims(naturals[2:])Our Python implementation doesnât really look like the Haskell one, but they are actually the same. It is much more concise than normal version of generating prime numbers, and we have a list that holds all the prime numbers! This is exciting even if the numbers are not actually computed.A RegretOur implementation here is incredibly powerful: you can do everything you can do to a lazy list. However, it is also incredibly slow. For example, the quicksort we built would take a while to sort a list with 1000 elementsâ something unimaginable in modern society.However, quicksort also has all the benefits of a lazy list. For example, if you only need one element from the resulted listâ like the Nâth smallest element, it will compute the element lazily. It runs quicksort on the list and stops just when it can determine the Nâth smallest element. Generally, it will behave like QuickFind algorithm on the first retrieval, taking O(N) time on average. If after getting the Nâth element, you suddenly want to access the Mâth element, and then (M+1)âth elementâ¦ They will take less and less time to complete because the list has become more and more âsortedâ, and the total comparisons wonât excess O( N * Log(N) ). It is not obvious how to implement the same thing in other non-lazy data structures (actually, I donât have a clue!).Hopefully youâve gained some more understanding about laziness and programming language itself after reading this post. It would be fun to build your own and try to beat my implementation, which is unfortunately quite unefficient.Many thanks.Originally published at ouromoros.github.io on December 17, 2018.]</td>\n",

       " Kotlinð 2018 resolutionKotlin was made first-class citizen for Android last year and since then it has grown exponentially, making it the fastest growing language of 2018, according to Githubâs 2018 Octoverse report:Kotlin in 2018 ðI wanted 2018 to be the year I definitely learn Kotlin. The tricky bit here is how do you measure this. How do you know youâve learned a programming language? Iâve been doing Java for more than 10 years and I learn new things in every project.I joined the Kotlin London meetupWatched Kotlin Conf 2017 &amp; 2018 most interesting talksI did the Kotlin KoansBut for the most part of the year, I felt I wasnât progressing enough.For me, the line to cross was to start a new Android project using Kotlin as the main language. And since last September weâre doing it! ðð· How Gradle tasks &amp; plugins workI wanted to understand better how Android projects are built, what tasks are expensive and why, and how to write my own plugins.The two main learning sources for me were:Novoda Android Static Analysis Plugin: an open-source project to easily setup static analysis tools for Android projects. Iâve been using it since I joined Novoda and it always felt like black magic to me. I thought that understanding deeply how it works it will improve my Gradle knowledge. And it did, kind of. I understand much better now this plugin works but I donât feel that has contributed much to my overall Gradle skills.Improving Android and Java Build Performance: I watched this video 2 or 3 times and Iâve used it as a reference to profile several Novoda projects. There are really good tips from the very Gradle Founder &amp; CEO, a must watch for everyone using Gradle in their projects.This topic is still a WIP for me as I still donât feel comfortable using advanced Gradle features. Itâs definitely something Iâll be investing more time in 2019.ð· Cloud PlatformsI want to learn more about Cloud platforms: what can we do with them, how can we use them to, for example, push domain logic up and share it among mobile platforms.Early this year, I attended Google Cloud OnBoard â London training day, which was a great introduction to everything Google Cloud has to offer. I even got a certificate!After that, I wanted to learn more about Docker so I took this Udemy Docker crash course for busy DevOps and Developers . The course is short and with a lot of practical examples. I recommended it as well.https://www.udemy.com/docker-tutorial-for-devops-run-docker-containers/Finally, these days weâre using Microsoft Azure Cloud for the backend technologies in the project Iâm currently working on.I did an internal presentation at Novoda on what Azure has to offer, and although itâs not public the interesting bit is this slide and some data that follows:What Azure has to offerAzure Cloud adoption is almost double than Google Cloud (Amazon still dominates)Azure is growing faster than Google and AmazonYou can start using it for free here https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/freeIn 2019 Iâll definitely invest time on Cloud Platforms. I donât know much about Amazon and I want to, at least, being able to compare the three big ones in terms of features.â Android P: whatâs newAndroid Pie was announced this year and, before the announcement, some beta versions were released for developers.At Novoda, we wanted to learn what was new and what of that new stuff could be useful to our clients before the official announcement.I pictured this as a series of blogposts and samples exploring every new aspect of Android P. I put together a big Jira story with a bunch of subtasks, one for each of the new features in P that we considered interesting to investigate.The reality is that it never happened. Documentation is very limited for those beta versions. We started with loads of energy but then we found itâs a very time-consuming task and itâs hard to justify the time invested in learning these things if you ended up never using them in a project.In the end, three interesting resources were produced and shared:Android P slices part 1 &amp; part 2 posts (plus a sample app) by Sebastiano PoggiAndroid P cutout demoGetting started with ARCore on Android blogpostFor next yearâs Android Q weâll try to take a different approach. I still donât know which, but thereâs good learning here of what not to do.â",
       " CircleCICircleCI is becoming very popular this year and I wanted to give it a try in a real project.At Novoda, we normally use a local Jenkins running in a powerful machine with several slave nodes for our projects. There are pros &amp; cons in using a local CI vs a cloud-hosted one and Iâm not going to go into details about them here.My approach to adopting CircleCI in a clientâs project was this:Use it to build a dummy pet project. This helped me understand the basics. CircleCI documentation is very good and a perfectly valid starting point.Use it to build an existing Novoda project. Carl-Gustaf Harroch, Novodaâs CTO, told me one day: âof course it works fine with a pet project, try to build the most complex project we have and then come back to meâ. So I did that: forked a project thatâs been with us for more than 4 years now with tons of custom scripts and legacy stuff and I replicated the build pipeline on CircleCI.Use it in a new project. We started with the free tier and weâve recently upgraded to the next one, enabling parallel execution for our most expensive task â which has reduced our build times a lot!Iâm very happy with CircleCI and will definitely keep working with it in 2019.The most useful resource Iâve found to learn CircleCI tips &amp; tricks is to checkout configs from opensource projects. Here are some of the ones Iâve been using:SquanchyTiviPlaidPhilologyâ iOSOne of my resolutions for 2018 was to learn more about iOS: IDE, deployment tools and swift.I havenât even started with this. I thought I could plan and do it on my own but, looking back, it seems that signing up for a course will be better: it will give me a framework to follow and force me to stick to a plan.â Vue.jsI used to work as front-end developer ages ago, back when Ajax was the new cool thing. So I thought it would be fun to learn what the kids use these days.I spend some time learning Vue.js and put together a pet project to display open PRs, issues, and collaborators for an organisation public repositories.It worked fine but I never followed up, nor took the time to clean it up to publish it or write about it.Now Iâve forgotten almost everything about Vue.js :(My learning here is to invest time in learning completely new things if you have a plan to continue using them, otherwise, all the effort will be wasted.â",

There are still tons of things for me to learn about them, but I donât need to make an active extra effort now to learn them, just regular everyday work.ð· Functional programmingThis is definitely in very early stages for me. Iâve been reading and watching talks about Functional Programming the whole year and I still feel Iâm only scratching the surface here.So far, I havenât found a tutorial or course to follow that works for me.So I ended up watching random talks and reading tutorials without a guideline.I learned more from a week pairing with pablisco than anything else in this year. Now, every time Iâm designing a piece of code I ask myself: âdoes this really needs an object or a simple function would do?âFor 2019 Iâm planning to read http://haskellbook.com/Iâm not interested in Haskell but Iâve been told itâs a good book to understand Functional Programming principles. I hope it gives me some guidelines to follow.â",
       " AOSP KeyboardThis was a fun spike we did for a project that didnât go through at the end. But I personally learned quite a bit about how the AOSP keyboard works and had the opportunity to spend some time working with Sebastiano Poggi which is always a pleasure.That project to build an AOSP keyboard that replaces what you write with Pirate talk is still in my TODO Seb!2. Novoda InternalThis is a list of some the things Iâve been working at Novoda this year. These are not things I planned to learn about, but instead, responsibilities I took upon myself.ð· Android GuildGuilds are part of our self-learning organisation. There are several guilds at Novoda around different topics everyone is welcome to join and participate in their meetings.Iâve been coordinating the Android Guild, which groups together everyone interested in Android stuff: mostly engineers, but also designers and product people.We started the year gathering together every other week with no specific agenda to chat about news or interesting stuff we came across. That didnât work.Now weâre trying a different approach: we have a shared document where everyone can add a topic they want to present or chat about, and people vote for the next session. Since we implemented that, we had light talks about Flutter, Google Photos API and Kotlin Native.Iâm really excited to see how this evolves in 2019.ð· The benchNot everyone at Novoda is assigned to a clientâs project. Those not assigned are on the bench (we call it PT internally) Itâs expensive but important to always have people on the bench because it allows us to start a new project right away.But while they wait for a new project to start people need to do something.This year Iâve been adding more structure to the bench. Now, those on the bench work together as any other team: we have one-week sprints, a backlog, and daily standups. The stories they work on vary from Novoda internal needs (tidy up that Jenkins machine) to help with project proposals or tech spikes.â Skills MatrixThis year I also worked with our head of engineering, Paul Blundell, in a company-wide skills matrix to list all our skills and how proficient people were at every one of those skills.Iâm marking this as a failure. Collecting and defining them was a lot of work and we never followed up.The aim was to know our strengths and weakness, and who was good at what, so we can plan projects and learning opportunities.For 2019 weâll need to find a better way.ð· Line ManagerWe are introducing the concept of line manager in the Novoda structure.This is in very early stages and 2019 will be the year to develop this but as one of the people whoâs going to be managing other engineers in the organisation Iâve been trying to improve my skills on the topic.In October we did a one-day session: âHR for Non-HR managersâ, which was very inspiring and weâll do more next year. Iâve also used part of my learning budget to sign up for this Coursera course https://coursera.org/specializations/leading-teams , which Iâm doing at the moment.For 2019 Iâm going to be reading more books about people and management skills.3. BlogpostsThis year, as every year, I wrote and share less than what I wanted.This is a constant source of frustration for me and I donât know how to solve it. Every new year resolution list I can remember contains a âwrite more blogposts &amp; share moreâ item. And every year ends with the feeling that I could have done more.Stats of my Medium stories inThings Iâve written this year plus some I planned to do but never did:â",

ConferencesThis is a list of conferences I went to, participate into or speak at.Freakend MobileHow can I describe this? Itâs a weekend-long retreat in a beautiful countryside hotel, outside of Madrid. There were talks, boardgames, food, drinks and tons of fun.Registration for 2019 is already open https://flipper83.github.io/freakend-mobile/Lambda WorldIt happens every year in CÃ¡diz, and itâs one of the best Functional Programming conferences around the World.What I enjoyed the most was this workshop to learn Arrow by fixing the broken tests of a webservice implemented in Ktor47deg/ArrowInPracticeLambda.World CÃ¡diz 2018 Workshop - Encoding Functional web services using Arrow and Ktor - 47deg/ArrowInPracticegithub.comI came back with more questions than answers, but I guess thatâs part of the learning process.TODO-LondonI gave a talk at TODO London titled âWhatâs a senior developerâ where I tried to explain what I think it means to be âseniorâ in this industry and what are the steps one needs to take to get thereTODO London is an awesome meetup that happens once a week:A monthly meet-up telling personal stories from the tech community to help you be better at what you doLondroidIâve been the face of Londroid for almost two years now and itâs been great.Londroid is one of the oldest and largests Android meetups out there and we gather together every month for two amazing talks, drinks and pizza.Every month we go to a different venue, which has been great to know more about the different companies doing Android in London.The same people attend regularly and it has turned into the monthly event to catch up with friends and colleagues for me.Londroid @ Microsoft LondonIf you want to present at or host a Londroid event, please contact us at londroid@novoda.comGoogle IO 2018I didnât go to Google IO this year. Instead, I helped organising the trip for the 7 Novodians that went there.This year we decided to approach the annual Google IO trip like a project: we defined tasks for it (what the team wanted to learn or get from it) and things to do when coming back: write a blogpost about something youâve learned or run a kata to teach it to your colleagues.My colleagues wrote this post with the things that excited them the most this edition:We went to Google I/O 2018, here's what we are excited aboutAs every year, a selection of Novoda team members headed to Shoreline Amphitheatre last week for Google I/O 2018. Theyâ¦blog.novoda.comWe even did a retro afterward to evaluate if the project was successful, what we liked about it and what we could have done differently.5. BooksThe books Iâve enjoyed the most this year are:Death by meeting: anyone doing meetings as part of their job should read this book. It explains what kind of meetings you should be doing, why and how often.The five dysfunctions of a team: same author as Death by Meeting. In this one, he explains how members of a team should collaborate with each other.The subtle art of not giving a f*ck: this is one of those rare books that change how you see your life. For me, it had a great impact on how I see things: what to care for and why.The Phoenix Project: this is a fun and exciting story of an IT manager thatâs promoted to VP of Engineering in a large company and must deal with all sort of fires. Very fun and educational.2019 is going to be a really exciting year at Novoda.

Unfortunately, that wasnât the case for me this afternoon, working on a Phoenix project with a newly-added Ecto backend. In an effort to save others (and letâs be honest, future me) the same frustration, hereâs the most straight-forward solutions I found.What Doesnât WorkMix. By default, Mix tasks arenât compiled into your deployed release, and as evidenced in this exciting discussion, thereâs no plans to change this any time soon.So donât try using your trusty local mix ecto.migrate task on production. Not gonna help you here.What Does Work1. Ecto.MigratorEcto ships with Ecto.Migrator, a first-class module for Ectoâs migration API.Run it manually by sshâing onto your app server, attaching to your Phoenix app, and running the following:path = Application.app_dir(:my_app, âpriv/repo/migrationsâ)Ecto.Migrator.run(MyApp.Repo, path, :up, all: true)Ideally, youâd wrap up the above in its own task that can be called during your build and deployment process. Check out Plataformatecâs blog for a nice example.2. eDeliverOur app uses edeliver for deployments, and it has a super handy command for manually running migrations:mix edeliver migrate productionIf we peek at the source, turns out this command actually just wraps up Ecto.Migrator for you, saving some precious keystrokes.To run successfully, youâll need to add ECTO_REPOSITORY=âMyApp.Repoâ to your .deliver/config file.Again, Plataformatec has a nice blog post on deploying your Elixir app with eDeliver.SummaryHi future me!
