Because just a decade ago, we could not even imagine that technology would be a blessing in disguise for organizational growth. Think about yourself. Could you ever think that there will be a virtual assistant to answer your every query instead of a customer care executive? No right?In our previous blog “ Digital Transformation: The Unsung Hero During COVID-19 Pandemic “ we discussed how COVID 19 has been aa blessing in disguise throughout. In this alarming scenario. In this blog, we are going to tell you about the skills you will require as a digital transformation officer to keep up the good work even in the post COVID19 scenario. But firstly, let us tell you about the responsibilities of a digital transformation officer in brief.With the rapid change of the global market and increasing customer demand, the responsibilities of Digital Transformation Officers as well are expanding day by day. Digital transformation of organizations can be a challenging task since every task will be either automated or heavily dependent on new technologies like Machine Learning, AI, Data Science and many more. Digital Transformation Officer is the one who can make this entire process a cakewalk by enlightening the employees about the new changes and guiding them through it. He monitors the entire digital growth of the organization and is responsible for incorporating new tools and technologies in order to give the business goals a new dimension. To summarize it, Digital Transformation Officer is the one who bridges the gap between business growth and the business growth the organization can achieve with the help of Digital Transformation. And to do the same, there is a set of soft skills as well as technical skills required. Here are the 5 must-have skills we have listed out that is required to become a Digital Transformation Officer. Have a look!Top 5 Skills to Become a Digital Transformation Officer:1. Big Data Analytics:Well, this one goes without saying. Can any organizations work without data? Of course not! So, how does the Big Data Analytics exactly help the organization in digital transformation? Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze data sets and systematically extract information to deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many cases offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate. Big data challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: , and. When we handle big data, we may not sample but simply observe and track what happens. Therefore, big data often includes data with sizes that exceed the capacity of traditional software to process within an acceptable time and On the other hand, Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming, and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusion and supporting decision-making. Data analysis has multiple facets and approaches, encompassing diverse techniques under a variety of names, and is used in different business, science, and social science domains. In today’s business world, data analysis plays a role in making decisions more scientific and helping businesses operate more effectively. So if we club them together, it can be a huge help for any organization. Big Data analytics is a term used to describe the examination of a large amount of data to see what patterns or other useful information can be found. Hence, if you are aspiring to become a digital transformation officer, it’s mandatory for you to know how to organize and analyze the data you have collected with the help of Big Data Analytics.2. Machine Learning:How much do we depend on automation today? You already know the answer to this one, since you are already using some kind of automation or the other at your workspace. Isn’t it? In order to make automation the main key to your digital transformation, one must have knowledge of machine learning. Machine learning is an application of Artificial Intelligence. It is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience. It is seen as a subset of artificial intelligence. Machine learning algorithms build a mathematical model based on sample data, known as “training data”, in order to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. Machine learning is closely related to computational statistics, which focuses on making predictions using computers. The study of mathematical optimization delivers methods, theory, and application domains to the field of machine learning. Data mining is a related field of study, focusing on exploratory data analysis through unsupervised learning. In its application across business problems, machine learning is also referred to as predictive analytics.Machine learning algorithms are used in a wide variety of applications to impact business growth. Some of its common uses are such as email filtering and computer vision, where it is difficult or infeasible to develop conventional algorithms to perform the needed tasks. Hence, Machine Learning ahas the ability to accelerate the digital transformation of any organization to an entirely new horizon. And as a Digital Transformation Officer, you should have an in-depth knowledge of Machine Learning to make it work.3.
